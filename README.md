rakudo-star-daily
=================

Daily build reports on rakudo-star to track module tests.

Creates a rakudo-star build for each of the three backends (jvm, moar, parrot).

Test the latest version of each backend (where appropriate) and the latest version of each module.

See log/* for the daily outputs.

If you see a failure in any of the log files, please open an issue with the appropriate backend/module.
