===SORRY!===
I see a .git directory here -- you appear to be trying
to run Configure.pl from a clone of the Rakudo Star git
repository.
The git repository contains the tools needed to build a Rakudo Star
release, but does not contain a complete Rakudo Star release.
To download and build the latest release of Rakudo Star, please
download a .tar.gz file from http://rakudo.org/downloads/star/ .
