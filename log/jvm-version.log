    Add unit declarator to class declarations

commit 87a1cf9aef7f1e3439e6933bd497aec083746b2a
Author: Paul Cochrane <paul@liekut.de>
Date:   Wed May 27 08:44:49 2015 +0200

    Add unit declarator to class declarations
    
    As of Rakudo 2015.05, the `unit` declarator is required before using
    `module`, `class` or `grammar` declarations (unless it uses a block).  Code
    still using the old blockless semicolon form will throw a warning. This
    commit stops the warning from appearing in the new Rakudo.

    Fix very incorrect list tests
    
    These tests actually expected that multi-level lists would flatten into
    a single level, and that was the issue.
